# ðŸ“‚ Distributed Database Management Tutorials

Welcome to the Distributed Database Management Tutorials repository!

These tutorials were developed as part of my role as the Head Teaching Assistant for the Distributed Database Management course at Technion. While they build on previous materials, they are being refined, expanded, and supplemented throughout the semester.

Check out [Noam's Spark course](https://github.com/cnoam/spark-course) as some of the .ipynb notebooks are heavily based on it.
