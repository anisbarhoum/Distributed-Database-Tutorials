# ðŸ“‚ Distributed Database Management Tutorials

Welcome to the Distributed Database Management Tutorials repository!

These tutorials were developed as part of my role as the Head Teaching Assistant for the Distributed Database Management course at Technion. While they build on previous materials, they are being refined, expanded, and supplemented throughout the semester.

Please check [Noam's Spark course](https://github.com/cnoam/spark-course) as the .ipynb notebooks are heavily based on it.

## ðŸ“– What you'll find here

These tutorials cover the following topics:

- [Tutorial 1: Data Formats and Python Warmup](#) *(To be posted)*
- [Tutorial 2: MapReduce](tutorials/02-MapReduce/)
- [Tutorial 3: Introduction to Apache Spark](tutorials/03-IntroToSpark/)

ðŸ“Œ New tutorials and updates will be added progressively as the semester unfolds.
